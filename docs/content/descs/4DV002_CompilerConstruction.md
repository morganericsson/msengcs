# 4DV002 - Compiler Construction (5 hec)

## Prerequisites

1DV003, 1DV006, 1MA004, 1DV008.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Describe the different phases in the compilation process
1. Describe semantic analysis
1. Describe different parsing techniques
1. Define type systems for typical programming languages

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Design and develop a finite automata based lexical analysis
1. Design and develop a semantic analysis
1. Design and develop an LL(1) parser
1. Design and develop a stack­machine based virtual machine
1. Implement type checking, including simple type inference, with error reporting and decoration of syntax trees with type information

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Judge the difficulty of implementing various programming language features.
