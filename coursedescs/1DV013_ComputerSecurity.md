## Grading

The course is assessed with the grades A, B, C, D, E, Fx or F.
Each assignment and the final exam will be graded separately and then weighed together for the final grade. All parts (A1-A4 + WE) have to be passed to pass the entire course.
The grade A constitutes the highest grade on the scale and the remaining grades follow in descending order where the grade E is the lowest grade on the scale that will result in a pass.
The grade F means that the student’s performance is assessed as fail.
