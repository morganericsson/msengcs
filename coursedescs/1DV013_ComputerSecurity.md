## Course contents
The course is an introductory course in IT Security. It should give basic understanding of threats and opportunities in the area and knowledge about tools available used to manage security. The main emphasis of the course is within Computer Security.
The following parts are treated:

- IT and society’s vulnerability.
- Information Security.
- Multi-level security.
- Ethics and IT law.
- Vulnerability analysis on an organizational level
- Basic security mechanisms (cryptography, authentication, access control)
- Program Security (buffer overflows, secure programming)
- Security in Operating Systems.
- Security in Databases.
- Network security
- Malware (virus/worm/trojans)


## Modules

1. Information security and IT Security in the society
2. Technical aspects of IT Security

## Examination
The examination is based on: 

Written exam and assignments (A1, A2, A3, A4)
	A1 - Encryption
	A2 - Attitude survey on attitudes about IT Security 
	A3 - Program Security
	A4 - Information Security (evaluating an organization and setting up security policies and plans)

## Grading

The course is assessed with the grades A, B, C, D, E, Fx or F.
Each assignment and the final exam will be graded separately and then weighed together for the final grade. All parts (A1-A4 + WE) have to be passed to pass the entire course.
The grade A constitutes the highest grade on the scale and the remaining grades follow in descending order where the grade E is the lowest grade on the scale that will result in a pass.
The grade F means that the student’s performance is assessed as fail.

The course introduces the area of IT security and consists of three parts. The first part has a focus on computer security and primarily covers ISO security services (secreccy, privacy, non-repudiation, authentication and access control), malicious software and operating system security. This course component also includes an introduction to cryptography. Part two centres on network security and treats the areas of IP security, web security, transport storage security, hacking detection and firewalls. Part three deals with security management with a focus on relevant security areas of laws and privacy.
