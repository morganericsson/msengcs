1. List the general concepts of modelling and simulation. 
2. Classify various simulation models (e.g., Discrete Event Systems, continuous, agent-based)
3. Summarise parallel and distributed simulation methods
4. Recall main types of software tools for modelling and simulation


*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Construct appropriate deterministic models for the simulation of given characteristics of computing systems
2. Construct appropriate non-deterministic/stochastic models for the simulation of given characteristics computing systems
3. Differentiate between the most convenient simulation approach for a given problem.


*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Reflect on benefits and drawbacks of modelling approaches. 
2. Judge the validity of simulation output

## Examination

The examination is based on: a [home] exam (E), 2 Assignments (A1, A2) and a delivery of a practice project (P1). 

- Exam will evaluate the knowledge and understanding learning outcomes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3., skill learning outcome 2.3, and judgement learning outcome 3.2

- Assignment A1 will asses the learning outcome 2.1

- Assignment A2 will asses the learning outcome 2.2

- Practice project will asses the skills learning outcome 2.3 and judgement learning outcomes 3.1, 3.2



The examination is based on: 

- Module 1: Assignments (A1, A2)
- Module 2: Project Development (P)
- Final: Home Exam (HE)

## Grading

The course is assessed with the grades A, B, C, D, E, Fx or F.
The grade A constitutes the highest grade on the scale and the remaining grades follow in descending order where the grade E is the lowest grade on the scale that will result in a pass.
The grade F means that the student’s performance is assessed as fail.
