# 1DV001 - Programming (7.5 hec)

## Prerequisites

None.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Explain basic programming language constructs, such as variables, control statements, and functions.
1. Explain basic algorithms and data structures, and show how to use them, and when to use them.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Given a problem, design and implement a solution in the programming language Python.
1. Formulate and implement algorithms to solve elementary programming problems, such as sorting and searching.
1. Install and use suitable IDEs and external libraries
1. Structure a short oral and written presentation presenting the result of a minor programming project

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Reason about how well structured and understandable a program is.
1. Pick and motivate what data structures and algorithms to use in different scenarios.

## Course contents

This is a basic course in Python programming. In the first half of the course (examinated by 3 individual programming assignments and a programming test) we focus on the fundamentals of Python programming  language (e.g. variables, control statements, functions) and practice programming skills by solving a 
number of programming exercises. 

In the second half we  introduce a few well-known algorithms and data structures. By implementing 
these algorithms  and data structures, and by comparing these implementations with the existing 
(built in) versions, we get a better knowledge of how they work, when they are appropriate to use, 
and we learn to reason about efficiency and complexity of different approaches. The second half 
is a miniprojekt where students work in pairs and report their finding by the end of the course.

- How a computer works and programs are executed.
- How to break down a problem so a computer can solve it.
- Fundamental programming level constructs.
- File I/O
- Using external libraries, e.g., mathpylab
- Using classes, objects, and modules
- Common data structures, e.g., lists, vectors, sets, etc.
- Common algorithms, e.g., sorting, searching, etc.
- Simple time-complexity estimates

## Modules

- Programming assignment (PA) 1 - 3, 1 credit each
- Programming test (PT), 1 credit
- Algorithm and data structure project (P), 2.5 credits
- Oral and written report (R), 1 credit 

Programming assignments PA1, PA2, and PA3 are submitted for grading. PA3 is also demonstrated and discussed at a tutoring session.

The programming test is an individual examination of programming 
skills where students are asked to solve a few programming exercises 
while being monitored. 

## Types of instruction
The types of instruction for this course encompass traditional lectures for teaching the majority of the course content. 
In addition, the content is exercised and deepened in context of tutoring sessions related to the practical lab assignments. 
All assignments are carried out individually, the project and the oral written reports are carried out in groups of two students.

## Examination

The assignments and the programming test are used to examine outcomes 
related to programming language constructs, programming skills, and (implicitly)the handling of IDEs and external libraries.

The project is about algorithms and data structures. The students will be asked to implement and evaluate certain algorithms and data structures. The result of the project is, in the end of the course, presented for the other students orally and (for the teachers) in a written report. Completing the programming part of the projekt and corresponds to 2.5 credits, submitting written report, make an oral presentation, and attending all presentations give 1 credit.  

The project and oral and written presentations takes care of the remaining outcomes not handled by the assignments and 
the programming test. 

## Grading

The course is assessed with an A-F grading.  If one of the modules is failed, then final course grade is F.

The modules programming test and oral and written report are graded as Pass or Fail. If both are passed, the final course grade is an A-F grade based on a weighted average of the A-F grades received for the two modules: programming assignments (60%) and project (40%).


In order to relate the learning outcomes to the two assessment types and individual assignments, we provide the following table:
