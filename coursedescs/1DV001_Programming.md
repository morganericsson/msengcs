# 1DV001 - Programming (7.5 hec)

## Prerequisites

None.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Explain basic programming language constructs, such as variables, control statements, and functions.
- Explain basic algorithms and data structures, and show how to use them, and when to use them.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Given a problem, design and implement a solution in the programming language Python.
- Formulate and implement algorithms to solve elementary programming problems, such as sorting and searching.
- Install and use suitable IDEs and external libraries
- Structure a short oral and written presentation presenting the result of a minor programming project

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Reason about how well structured and understandable a program is.
- Pick and motivate what data structures and algorithms to use in different scenarios.

## Course contents

This is a basic course in Python programming. In the first half of the course (examinated by 3 individual programming assignments and a programming test) we focus on the fundamentals of Python programming  language (e.g. variables, control statements, functions) and practice programming skills by solving a 
number of programming exercises. 

In the second half we  introduce a few well-known algorithms and data structures. By implementing these algorithms  and data structures, and by comparing these implementations with the existing (built in) versions, we get a better knowledge of how they work, when they are appropriate to use, and we learn to reason about efficiency and complexity of different approaches. The second half is a miniprojekt where students work in pairs and report their finding by the end of the course.

- How a computer works and programs are executed.
- How to break down a problem so a computer can solve it.
- Fundamental programming level constructs.
- File I/O
- Using external libraries, e.g., mathpylab
- Using classes, objects, and modules
- Common data structures, e.g., lists, vectors, sets, etc.
- Common algorithms, e.g., sorting, searching, etc.
- Simple time-complexity estimates

## Modules

- Programming Assignment 1 - 3, 1 credit each
- Programming Test, 1 credit
- Algorithm and Data Structure Project, 2.5 credits
- Oral and Written Report, 1 credit 

## Types of instruction

## Examination

The assignments and the test are used to examine outcomes 
related to programming language constructs, programming skills, and (implicitly)
the handling of IDEs and external libraries.

The project is about algorithms and data structures. The students will be asked to implement and 
evaluate certain algorithms and data structures. The result of the project is, in the end of the course, 
presented for the other students orally and (for the teachers) in a written report. Completing the programming 
part of the projekt and corresponds to 2.5 credits, submitting written report, make an oral presentation, and
attending all presentations give 1 credit.  

The project and oral and written presentations takes care of the remaining outcomes not handled by the assignments and 
the programming test.
