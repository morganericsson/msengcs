# [%PrelCode] - [%Name] ([%HEC] hec)

## Prerequisites

1MA001, 1MA002, 1DV003, 1DV004, 1DV006.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Explain various algorithms for identifying visible surfaces.
- Explain local illumination models
- Characterize all aspects of the computer graphics pipeline, i.e., the various steps and algorithms that occur from a geometric 3D object specification to the rendering of a corresponding 2D display image
- Describe and implement different types of object representations
- Define basic color models typically used in computer graphics

 *2.Skills and abilities*

- Implement basic 2D graphics solutions by using OpenGL
- Implement rasterization algorithms for basic output primitives
- perform and implement geometric, camera, projection and viewport transformations

 *3. Judgement and approach*

- Reflect upon the properties of different algorithms, e.g., and pick those suitable for the problem.
- Reason about the impact choices, e.g., lightening and color representation has on the output quality.
