# 4DV007 -  Parallel computing (5 hec)

## Prerequisites


- Programming skills (1DV001)
- Communication and synchronization of programs (1DV004)
- Data structures and assessment of the complexity of algorithms (1DV006)
- Knowledge on how hardware is designed (1DV008)
- Knowledge on reference architectures for digital devices (1DV011)


## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Describe and explain the fundamentals of parallel computing systems
2. Describe fundamentals of programming models and languages for parallel
computing
3. Explain different parallelization techniques and reference algorithms. 
4. Describe topologies of interconnection networks used in clusters for parallel computing. Identify networking issues in parallel systems. 

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Design and implement parallel versions of common serial algorithms and data structures.
2. Design and implement programs that run efficiently on parallel computing systems.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Reason about the performance of a system, and the potential and limitations of parallel processing with respect to computing resources, networking and coordination. 



## Course contents

- Goals of parallel computing. Parallelism Vs concurrency. Problems solved by parallelization. 
- Introduction to parallel and multi-core computing architectures. - Programming models for parallel computing. Software frameworks for executing parallelizable jobs. 
- Programming languages for parallel computing
- Patterns for parallel algorithms. Communication and coordination of parallel programs  
- Performance improvement with parallel computing. Speedup, throughput, scalability, Amdahl's law.
- Performance evaluation of parallel algorithms. 

## Modules

- Programming Assignments - 2 credits (1 credit each)
- Practical Exercise Assignment - 1 credit
- Written exam - 2 credits

## Types of instruction

The types of instruction for this course encompass traditional lectures for teaching the theoretical content of the course content. In addition, the content is exercised by practical lectures that will cover problem solving and design of parallel programs. 

Moreover, the content regarding implementation of parallel programs and the application of patterns for parallel algorithms is exercised and deepened in context of practical lab assignments. 
All assignments are carried out individually or in fixed groups of maximal two students.


## Examination

The learning outcomes of this course are assessed with the help of a written exam (WE) to evaluate knowledge and understanding and judgement learning outcomes, two programming assignments (PA) that evaluate the skills and a Practical Exercise (PE) that a evaluates understanding and judgment.


## Grading

The course is assessed with an A-F grading. If one of the modules is failed, then final course grade is F. 

To pass a module, the student needs at least 50% of the points, otherwise the course is failed. The grading table is provided in the following:

|Final Grade (A-F) | Grading Points (%) |
| ---------------  | ------------------ |
| A                | >= 90              |
| B                | >= 80              |
| C                | >= 70              |
| D                | >= 60              |
| E                | >= 50              |

Each practical programming assignment will be graded with points. To pass the Programming assignments module, the average of points of the three assignments shall be at least 50%.

If all the three modules are passed, then the course is passed and the final course grade is an A-F grade based on a weighted average of 40% for the Written Exam, 40% for the Programming Assignments and 20% for the Practical exercise. 

In order to relate the learning outcomes to the assessments, we provide the following table:
