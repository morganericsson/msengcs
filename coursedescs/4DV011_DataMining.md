# [%PrelCode] - [%Name] ([%HEC] hec)

## Prerequisites

- Java programming and corresponding data structures, 1DV001
- Algorithms, 1DV006
- Vector and matrix calculus, 1MA002
- Logarithmic and exponential functions, 1MA003

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Describe the foundational concepts underlying data mining
2. Define and explain algorithms and concepts for search engines, recommendation systems and clustering
3. Define and explain algorithms and concepts for data quality and preprocessing, dimensionality reduction and similarity and dissimilarity

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Perform and implement algorithms for clustering
2. Perform and implement techniques for data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction using common libraries

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Reflect upon the properties of different algorithms and pick those suitable for the problem to be solved
2. Reason about the impact that choices, e.g., specific algorithms and data representations, have on system performance and quality

## Course contents

Data mining is an area aiming to give meaning to unstructured data. This course offers an introduction into data mining and includes common data mining 
tasks suchs as search engines, recommendation systems and clustering. The course also includes important techniques used in data mining systems such as 
finding similar or dissimilar items, evaluating data quality and perform data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction of data.

## Types of Instruction

The types of instruction for this course encompass traditional lectures for teaching the majority of the course content. In addition, the content is exercised and deepened 
in context of practical lab assignments. All assignments are carried out individually or in fixed groups of maximal two students.

## Modules

- Practical assignments, 2.5 credits
- Theoretical assignment, 2.5 credits

## Examination

The learning outcomes of this course are assessed with the help of a written exam (WE) to evaluate knowledge and understanding of data mining concepts teached in the lectures. 
These theoretical assignments also contain higher level questions in order to assess if the students are able to critically reflect upon the different approaches and what impact 
these may have on the performance and quality of data mining systems. In addition, 2 programming assignments (PA) are used to mainly evaluate the studentsâ€™ skills in algorithm 
implementation and practical use of common APIs and libraries for data mining tasks.

## Grading

The course is assessed with an A-F grading. The two modules are separately evaluated and graded. The WE and 2 PAs in the two modules must be passed individually. If one 
of the modules is failed, then final course grade is F. If both are passed, the final course grade is an A-F grade based on the combination of the points received for the two 
modules, and both of them are equally weighted. In more detail, total grade points = WE points / 2 + PA points / 2. To pass a module or the entire course, the student needs at 
least 50% of the points, otherwise the course is failed. The grading table is provided in the following:

|Final Grade (A-F) | Grading Points (%) |
| ---------------  | ------------------ |
| A                | >= 90              |
| B                | >= 80              |
| C                | >= 70              |
| D                | >= 60              |
| E                | >= 50              |

In order to relate the learning outcomes to the two assessment types and individual assignments, we provide the following table:

|  -   | WE  | PA1 | PA2 |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- | 
| 1.1  | X   | X   | X   | 
| 1.2  | X   | X   |     | 
| 1.3  | X   |     | X   | 
| 2.1  |     | X   |     | 
| 2.2  |     |     | X   | 
| 3.1  |     | X   | X   | 
| 3.2  |     | X   | X   |
