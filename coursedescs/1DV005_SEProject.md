## Grading
The course is assessed with the grades A, B, C, D, E, Fx or F.
The grade A constitutes the highest grade on the scale and the remaining grades follow in descending order where the grade E is the lowest grade on the scale that will result in a pass.
The grade F means that the student’s performance is assessed as fail.
