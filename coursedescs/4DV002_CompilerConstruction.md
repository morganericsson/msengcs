# [%PrelCode] - [%Name] ([%HEC] hec)

## Prerequisites

1DV003, 1DV006, 1MA004, 1DV008.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Describe the different phases in the compilation process
- Describe semantic analysis
- Describe different parsing techniques
- Define type systems for typical programming languages

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Design and develop a finite automata based lexical analysis
- Design and develop a semantic analysis
- Design and develop an LL(1) parser
- Design and develop a stack­machine based virtual machine
- Implement type checking, including simple type inference, with error reporting and decoration of syntax trees with type information

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Judge the difficulty of implementing various programming language features.

## Course contents
