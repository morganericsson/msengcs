# 4DV002 - Compiler Construction (5 hec)

## Prerequisites

Object-oriented programming skills -- 1DV003, 
Algorithms and data structures -- 1DV006, 
Discrete Mathematics -- 1MA004, 
Morgan??? -- 1DV008,
Model-driven Engineering -- Morgan???.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Describe the different phases in the compilation process
2. Describe semantic analysis
3. Describe different parsing techniques
4. Define type systems for typical programming languages
5. Describe basic principles for stack machines

*2. Skills and abilities*

1. Design a finite automata based lexical analysis and an LL(1) parser
2. Design and develop a semantic analysis including simple type inference, 
with error reporting and decoration of syntax trees with type information
3. Implement a parser using a given parser generator tool 
4. Design and develop a stack­machine based virtual machine

*3. Judgement and approach*

1. Judge the difficulty of implementing various programming language features.
2. Select an appropriate parsing technique for a given parsing problem.

## Course contents

This course does not only focus on presenting techniques, theories and tools used when constructing  a traditional compiler. The aim is also discuss how these ideas can be used to define and interpret domain specific languages in Model-driven Software Engineering. As a result, the course focuses on the 
compiler front-end and runtime interpretation of intermediate program representations.

- Different compilation phases
- Object­-oriented compiler design
- Lexical analysis based on finite automata and regular languages 
- Context­-free grammars and languages
- Different parsing techniques 
- Attributed grammars
- Semantic analysis
- Intermediate program representations
- Code generation
- Stack­machine based execution
- Type systems

## Modules

- Programming assignment (PA), 3 credits
- Written assignments (WA), 2 credits
- Written Exam (EX), 2.5 credits 

## Types of instruction

The types of instruction for this course encompass traditional lectures for teaching the majority of the course content. In addition, the content is exercised and deepened in context of tutoring sessions related to the practical and written assignments. The written assignments are carried out individually, the practical assignments are carried out in groups of two students.


## Examination

Written and practical assignments are handed out throughout the course. The written assignments  are used to examine the "define" parts in the learning outcomes, the practical assignments are  used to examine the "implement" or "develop" parts. The written examination is primarily used to  handle "describe" outcomes and outcomes related to "Judgement and Approach", but can also be used  to examine the "define" parts.

## Grading
Each course module is graded using A-F. If one module is failed, then final course grade is F. Otherwise, the final course grade is an A-F grade based on a weighted average of the A-F grades received for the three modules: written assignment (25%), programming assignments (40%), written exam (35%).

In order to relate the learning outcomes to the examination forms, 
we provide the following table:
