# 1DV003 - Object-oriented Programming (5 hec)

## Prerequisites

Basic programming skills - 1DV001
Oral and Written Presentations - 1DV002

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
1. Explain basic object oriented programming entities like classes, instances, messages, methods and polymorphism.
2. Explain the concepts modularization, abstraction, and encapsulation.
3. Explain and motivate the use of a few common design patterns.
4. Explain the most frequently used constructs in UML class and sequence diagrams.

*2.	Skills and abilities*
1. Implement object-oriented programs involving multiple classes in the programming language Java.
2. Component testing using JUnit
3. Draw class and sequence diagrams using the UML standard.
4. Implement (in Java) a few basic design patterns
5. Structure a written and oral presentation of a design


*3.	Judgement and approach*
1. Reason about various design decisions to handle a given problem.
2. Pick and motivate design patterns to use in different scenarios.

## Course contents

This is an introductory course in object-oriented programming for students that already  have a basic experience in programming (e.g. 1DV001 - Basic Programming). In the first part of  the course we focus on the fundamentals of Java programming (e.g. classes, instances, messages,  methods and polymorphism) and practice programming skills by solving a number of programming exercises. 

In the second part we introduce UML as tool for modeling object oriented design solutions and the concept  of design patterns as a tool to handle often occurring design and implementation problems.

- Basic Java constructs such as types, control statements, classes, fields, constructors, methods, and exceptions.
- Object-oriented concepts like interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism 
- Component testing using JUnit 
- Objected-oriented modeling using UML class and sequence diagrams
- Object-oriented design patterns such as Singleton, Iterator, Observer, Factory

## Modules
- Programming assignment 1 - 3 (PA), 1.5 credit each
- Object-oriented miniproject (MP), 2 credit
- Oral and written presentation of a given design problem (OWD), 1 credit 

## Types of instruction

Teaching consists of lectures and supervision meeting related to practical assignments and projects. The assignments are individual, the projects are carried out in groups. Attendance at some activities is mandatory.

## Examination
Assignments 1 and 2 (Basic object-oriented programming in Java) are used to examine outcomes related to basic Java programming skills, JUnit testing and (implicitly) the knowledge and understanding of object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

Assignment 3 is about implementing design patterns and the miniproject is about designing and implementing an open and more complex problem scenario. Together they examine outcomes related design patterns and UML diagrams. The open problem formulation of the miniproject requires reasoning and judgement.

The design problem course module is about presenting a design (no implementation) for a more extensive scenario. It involves UML modeling, design patterns, reasoning, judgement and is examined in a written and oral presentation.

## Grading
Each course module is graded using A-F. If one module is failed, then final course grade is F. Otherwise,the final course grade is an A-F grade based on a weighted average of the A-F grades received for the three modules: programming assignments (50%), miniproject (30%) and presentations (20%).

In order to relate the learning outcomes to the two assessment types and individual assignments, we provide the following table:
