# 1DV007 - Databases (5 hec)

## Prerequisites

The student should be acknlowledged and possess at least basic skills in:
* Mathematics and algebra, including theory of sets
* Computer science and programming

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Define the basic concepts related to computer-based information systems and understand in depth the main issues related to data management in large organizations and enterprises
2. Understand the database taxonomy, reference data models, commit protocols and current technologies
3. Know the Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax and semantics


*2. Skills and abilities*

1. Design data models at different semantic levels (conceptual, logical, physical) using appropriate formalisms, including Entity-Relationships and relational models
2. Optimize database design by using normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF), also taking into account the characteristics of physical media used for data storage
3. Implement relational data models in current Data Base Management Systems (DBMS); create, query and manipulate data using SQL; connect to a database and execute queries using a programming language


*3. Judgement and approach*

1. Analyze a domain and its constraints as a data-model, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the design
2. Reflect upon the properties of different data-models and pick those more suitable for the problem to be solved
3. Reason about the impact that design choices imply on data-model quality and expected performance


## Course contents

This course offers an introduction into the most important theoretical and practical aspects of databases. Knowledge of databases is nowadays essential in most fields of computer science and engineering, and it becomes critical when managing information systems of complex applications and large enterprises. The course addresses:

* Introduction to computer-based information management systems
* Conceptual, Logical and Physical data-models design
* Entity-Relationships (ER) diagrams
* Relational data model and relational algebra
* Functional dependencies and normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
* Database querying and manipulation using SQL
* Two-phase locking and commit protocols
* Database technologies and software tools
* Accessing a database from a programming language
* Flashes on object-oriented and active databases


## Types of Instruction

The types of instruction for this course encompass traditional lectures for teaching the majority of the course content. 

Accessing a database from a programming language is only generally addressed in the course as it depends on the DBMS and programming language the students will use in their projects: students have to gain knowledge about that by self-studies (e.g. open online tutorials). 

In addition, the content is exercised and deepened in context of theoretical and practical assignments. All assignments are carried out individually.

## Modules

* Database Theory, Data Models, Design Methodology and Structured Query Language - Theoretical Assignments (TA), 2.5 credits
* Practical Database Design, Database Implementation and SQL Data Manipulation - Project Assignments (PA), 2.5 credits

## Examination

The learning outcomes of this course are assessed with the help of 2 theoretical assignments (TA) to evaluate knowledge and understanding of the database concepts taught in the lectures. These theoretical assignments also contain high-level questions in order to assess if the students are able to critically reflect upon the different design options and what impact these may have on the quality and expected performance of final database.
In addition, 2 project assignments are used to evaluate the students’ skills in database design and manipulation using SQL and programming languages. The teacher will provide some pointers to freely available tools and applications. A standard computer is sufficient to perform the tasks required for project development.

## Grading

The course is assessed with an A-F grading. The modules are separately evaluated and graded. Each of the assignments in the two modules must be passed individually. If one of the modules is failed, then final course grade is F. If both are passed, the final course grade is an A-F grade based on the combination of the points received for the two modules, and both them are equally weighted. In more detail, total grade points = TA points / 2 + PA points / 2. To pass a module or the entire course, the student needs at least 50% of the points, otherwise the course is failed. The grading table is provided in the following:

| Final Grade (A-F) | Grading Points (%) |
|-------------------|--------------------|
|  A                |  >= 90             |
|  B                |  >= 80             |
|  C                |  >= 70             |
|  D                |  >= 60             |
|  E                |  >= 50             |

In order to relate the learning outcomes to the two assessment types and individual assignments, we provide the following table:

| Learning Outcome | Assessment Type | TA1 | TA2 | PA1 | PA2 |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1              | TA              |**X**|     |     |     |
| 1.2              | TA              |**X**|     |     |     |
| 1.3              | TA + PA         |     |**X**|**X**|     |
| 2.1              | TA + PA         |     |**X**|**X**|**X**|
| 2.2              | TA + PA         |     |**X**|**X**|**X**|
| 2.3              | PA              |     |     |     |**X**|
| 3.1              | PA              |**X**|     |     |     |
| 3.2              | TA              |**X**|     |     |**X**|
| 3.3              | TA              |**X**|     |     |**X**|
