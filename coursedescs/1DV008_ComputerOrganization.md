# 1DV008 - Computer organization (7.5 hec)

## Prerequisites

1FY002, 1DV001, 1DV003, 1DV004.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Understand the role of abstraction in the design of digital systems.
- Explain the major software and hardware abstractions in contemporary computer systems.
- Understand the operation of a moderately complex digital system.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Analyze the performance of digital systems using measures such as latency and throughput.
- Design simple hardware systems based on a variety of digital abstractions such as ROMs and logic arrays, logic trees, state machines, pipelining, and buses.
- Analyze the operation of page-based virtual memory systems.
- Translate simple programs from a high-level language to machine language.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Assess the impact of an architectural technique on the performance of application software.
