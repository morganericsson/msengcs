## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

1. Knowledge and understanding
    1. Classify typical user tasks for visualizations
    2. Define and explain the visualization techniques (regarding interaction and visual representation) and example tools discussed in the course
    3. Recall and explain the fundamental perceptual principles that have influence on information visualization

2. Skills and abilities
    1. Represent data by expressive and effective visualizations using state-of-the-art methods, software, and tools
    2. Implement basic interactive visualizations, such as scatter plots or star plots

3. Judgement and approach
    1. Critically reflect on visualization and interaction approaches in the light of current theories and research
    2. Make well-grounded design choices in the context of various tasks and data constraints


## Course contents

Information Visualization (InfoVis) covers the use of visualization techniques and tools to help people understand and analyze abstract data. While related fields such as scientific  visualization involve the presentation of data that has some physical or geometric correspondence, information visualization centers on abstract information without such correspondences, i.e., information that cannot be mapped into the physical world in most cases. Examples of such abstract data are symbolic, tabular, networked, hierarchical, or textual information sources. The ever increasing amount of data generated or made available every day amplifies the urgent need for InfoVis tools. This course gives an overview of the most important InfoVis techniques as well as applications. Covered topics are:

* Definition of the field of information visualization and relationships to related fields such as human-computer interaction or scientific visualization
* Basics in visual perception (preattentive processing, Gestalt laws) and cognition
* Data and visualization foundations and processing
* Task abstractions and taxonomies
* Interaction concepts and techniques (e.g., dynamic queries, zoom and pan, or focus and context)
* Visualization techniques for 1D, 2D, 3D, and multidimensional data
* Overview of current systems and toolkits for information visualization

## Types of instruction

The types of instruction for this course encompass traditional lectures for teaching the majority of the course content. In addition, the content is exercised and deepened in context of conceptual and practical assignments. All assignments will be also discussed in a seminar setting where all students present their results and receive feedback from their fellow students and the instructor. This setting also provides a place to critically reflect on information visualizations based on theories and research results presented in the lectures. All assignments are carried out individually or in fixed groups of maximal two students.

## Modules

* Assignments, 3 credits
* Oral exam, 2 credits

## Examination

The learning outcomes of this course are assessed with the help of 4 assignments (A1-A4) and an oral exam (OE) for each student individually at the end of the course. The oral exam will take 30 minutes and is used to mainly evaluate knowledge and conceptual understanding of the visualization concepts and fundamentals teached in the lectures. The exam also encompasses higher level questions in order to assess if the students are able to critically reflect upon the different perceptual principles and fundamentals and what impact these may have on the final visualization. In addition, the four assignments are used to mainly evaluate the students’ skills to choose and implement expressive and effective visual representations as well as making well-grounded design choices in the context of specific tasks and example data sets. We only use programming libraries (e.g., D3 [1]) and visualization environments (e.g., Tableau [2]) that are freely available in general or for classroom use. Any standard laptop or desktop computer with an onboard graphics chip and/or dedicated graphics card is sufficient for the programming/visualization tasks. Passing the complete assignments module is the prerequisite for doing the oral exam.

## Grading

The complete course is assessed with an A-F grading. The two modules are separately evaluated and graded, but by using a different grading scheme and under the condition that the assignments module must be passed to be able to attend the oral exam. An individual assignment is passed if all tasks for this assignment are sufficiently solved following a three-level grading scheme: F (failed), P (passed), and P* (passed with distinction). P* is given for exceptionally good assignments with respect to clarity/precision of the answers and/or outstanding implementations/visualizations clearly above the average of the assignment submissions. The grade for the entire assignments module is the average of the grades of the individual assignments, but each of them must be passed at least.
The oral exam is assessed with an A-F grading. If the student finally fails the assignments module or the oral exam, then the final grade for the complete course is F. In all other cases, the final course grade is equal to the grade of the oral exam. A P* grade in the assignments module can be used to elevate the oral exam grade by maximal one level. The grading table for the oral exam is provided in the following:

| Final Grade (A-F) | Grading Criteria   |
|-------------------|--------------------|
|  A                |  sustained level of superior performance demonstrated in all learning outcomes (LO1-3) |
|  B                |  consistent level of performance that is clearly above average in the vast majority of the learning outcomes (LO1-3) |
|  C                |  performance that is generally average and most learning outcomes are achieved (LO1-3) |
|  D                |  below average performance and achievement of the learning outcomes (LO1-2) |
|  E                | minimal performance and achievement of the learning outcomes (LO1-2) |

The oral exam is performed in English. For this, a conversation between the student and the examiner must be possible, but the language capabilities (grammar, vocabulary used, etc.) have no influence on the final grade.

In order to relate the learning outcomes to the two assessment types and individual assignments, we provide the following table:

| Learning Outcome | Assessment Type | A1  | A2  | A3  | A4  | Oral Exam |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --------- |
| 1.1              | A + OE          |     |     |**X**|     | **X**     |
| 1.2              | A + OE          |     |     |     |**X**| **X**     |
| 1.3              | A + OE          |     |**X**|     |     | **X**     |
| 2.1              | A               |     |     |     |**X**|           |
| 2.2              | A               |     |     |**X**|     |           |
| 3.1              | A + OE          |**X**|     |     |     | **X**     |
| 3.2              | A + OE          |     |     |     |**X**| **X**     |

Late work will not be accepted without prior approval by the instructor. Reasons for accepted delays may be proven health conditions, no-fault hardships, etc.

## Overlap

80% with 4DV800. The tree visualization from 4DV800 was removed and instead a deeper discussion on tasks abstractions and taxonomies added.
