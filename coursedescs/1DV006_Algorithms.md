# [%PrelCode] - [%Name] ([15EC] hec)

## Prerequisites

None.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Describe algorithms and explain they properties, e.g., why they are fast or correct.
- Explain problems classes, such s P and NP, and recognize problems that belong to these. 
- Explain intractability and recognize such problems.
- Prove the correctness of an algorithm.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Analyze the complexity of algorithms.
- Perform simple reduction between problems
- Apply common techniques, such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greed, backtracking, to design algorithms to solve problems.
- Perform experimental validation of properties of algorithms, e.g., speed.
- For simple cases, design, implement, and prove the correctness of an algorithm.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Compare and decide on which algorithms to use to solve a problem, based on their properties.
- Reason about why an algorithm may be correct or not, and identify common pitfalls in algorithm design.
