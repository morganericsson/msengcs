# [%PrelCode] - [%Name] ([%HEC] hec)

## Prerequisites

- Java, OOP.
- Basic abstract data types: list, stack and queue. 
- Basic graph theory.


## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Describe algorithms and explain their properties, e.g., why they are fast or correct.
2. Recall problem complexity classes, such as P and NP, and recognize problems that belong to these. 
3. Explain intractability and identify such problems.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Determine the time and space complexities of algorithms and data structures.
2. Implement algorithms and data structures.
3. Perform experimental validation of properties of algorithms, e.g., speed.
4. Carry out simple reductions between algorithmic problems.
5. Apply common techniques, such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, or greedy to algorithm design.


*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Compare and decide on which algorithms and data structures to use based on application needs.
2. Reason about why an algorithm may be correct or not, and identify common pitfalls in algorithm design.

## Course contents

- Asymptotic analysis (big-O, Theta, Omega notation)
- Algorithm analysis (worst case, average case, best case)
- Abstract data types: dictionary, priority queue, union-find
- Sorting
- Graph algorithms
- Algorithm design paradigms (divide-and-conquer, greedy, dynamic programming)
- Introduction to complexity theory: intractability, complexity classes, completeness, reductions

## Modules

## Grading
The course is assessed with the grades A, B, C, D, E, Fx or F.
The grade A constitutes the highest grade on the scale and the remaining grades follow in descending order where the grade E is the lowest grade on the scale that will result in a pass.
The grade F means that the student’s performance is assessed as fail.
