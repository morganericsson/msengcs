## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Summarize software architecture concepts.
2. List Architectural Patterns/Styles.*

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Recognize an Architectural design problem.
2. Classify software architecture patterns and tactics and Determine its relevance with respect to the design problem.
3. Design a Software Architecture for a given design problem.
4. Judge a Software Architecture by measuring its Quality with respect to a given design problem.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Use software architectures documentation concepts and strategies.
2. Clarify on the connection between software architecture, product lines, software quality, and software reuse.

## Course contents

Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a system should be organized and designing the overall structure of that system. In the model of the software development process, architectural design is the first stage in the software design process. It is the critical link between design and requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system and the relationships between them. The output of the architectural design process is an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components. Software architecture is important because it affects the performance, robustness, distributability, and maintainability of a system. 

To this end, the objective of this course is to introduce the concepts of software architecture and architectural design:

- Software architecture concepts
- Architecture description techniques and architectural views
- Architectural styles and patterns
- Software product­line concepts and its architectures
- Software architecture design and evaluation
- Software architecture quality


## Modules

## Examination

The examination is based on: 2 Assignments (A1, A2), 1 Project Development (PD), and 1 Home exam (HE)

Objective | A1 | A2 | PD | HE

 1.1  |  X  |     |     |  X
 1.2  |     |  X  |  X  |  X
 2.1  |     |  X  |  X  |  
 2.2  |  X  |  X  |  X  |

 3.1  |  X  |  X  |  X  |
 3.2  |     |  X  |     |  X


## Grading
The course is assessed with the grades A, B, C, D, E, Fx or F.
The grade A constitutes the highest grade on the scale and the remaining grades follow in descending order where the grade E is the lowest grade on the scale that will result in a pass.
The grade F means that the student’s performance is assessed as fail.
