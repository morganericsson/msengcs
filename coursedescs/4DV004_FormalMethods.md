# 4DV004 - Formal methods (5 hec)

## Prerequisites

1MA001, 1MA004, 1DV006, 4DV001. 
(Also needs familiarity with propositional/predicate logic)

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

- reason abstractly about safety and security aspects of systems
- specify safety and security properties of systems at modelling and programming level using different logics
- apply various techniques and tools for checking and enforcing safety and security properties
- use runtime monitoring to enforce security policies

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. List methods and challenges in formal-based verification of safety and security properties of software systems
2. Use different techniques to verify the correctness and security of 
   1- systems at the modelling level, 
   2- programs
3. Employ verification tools like theorem provers and model checkers 

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Manage to express safety properties of (concurrent) systems formally using different logics
2. Master using the tools for verification

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Improved insight into the advantages of a formal-based system design in comparison to informal design and programming
2. Raised awareness about the socio-economical costs caused by faulty and insecure software systems
3. Judge the potential and limitations of using different verification methods for assessing and improving software correctness and security

## Course contents

- Introduction to the formal verification
- Classification of various verification techniques
- Propositional and predicate logic, Temporal Logics (LTL, CTL)
- Programming languages semantics
- Program verification using Hoar logics and separation logic 
- Model checking (LTL and CTL model checking)
- Runtime monitoring

## Modules
- Program Verification
- System Models Analysis

## Types of instruction

## Examination

- Two Projects (P1, P2) One on each module where students use one of the verification techniques to verify a program (P1) and a system model (P2)
- Written exam (WE) To evaluate their understandings from the fundamentals of the verification techniques 
- Oral exam (OE) To assess students' ability to explain their reasoning and understanding of the concepts
