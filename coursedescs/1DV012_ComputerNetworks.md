# 1DV012 - Computer networks (5 hec)

## Prerequisites

Writing medium complex Java programs
Understand file systems, processes (In the Operating systems context)
Understand basic properties of signals and electronics

1DV001, 1DV003, 1DV004, 1FY002, 1DV008.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Describe the layers in a networking stack, e.g., TCP/IP and discuss their purpose. 
1. Describe how the layers interact to transmit data over a network, and how each function manipulate the data, e.g., by adding headers or convert the signal.
1. Explain how routing works in local and wide area networks.
1. Describe the different types of addresses used.
1. Describe some of the common application protocols, e.g., DNS.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Use common networking debug utilities, e.g., tcpdump, ping, and traceroute.
1. Write programs in a programming language that communicate over TCP/IP.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Design a TCP/IP based application and select which protocols, application and/or transport to use.
1. Review Internet protocol specifications (RFCs) and implement these in software.
