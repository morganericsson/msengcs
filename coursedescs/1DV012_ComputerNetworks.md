# 1DV012 - Computer networks (5 hec)

## Prerequisites

Writing medium complex Java programs
Understand file systems, processes (In the Operating systems context)
Understand basic properties of signals and electronics

1DV001, 1DV003, 1DV004, 1FY002, 1DV008.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Describe the layers in a networking stack, e.g., TCP/IP and discuss their purpose. 
- Describe how the layers interact to transmit data over a network, and how each function manipulate the data, e.g., by adding headers or convert the signal.
- Explain how routing works in local and wide area networks.
- Describe the different types of addresses used.
- Describe some of the common application protocols, e.g., DNS.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Use common networking debug utilities, e.g., tcpdump, ping, and traceroute.
- Write programs in a programming language that communicate over TCP/IP.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Design a TCP/IP based application and select which protocols, application and/or transport to use.
- Review Internet protocol specifications (RFCs) and implement these in software.

## Course contents

- Layered protocol models, OSI and TCP/IP.
- Packet switching
- Physical data communication.
- Data link protocols.
- Local networks (e.g., topology, access control, IEEE 802 standards).
- Transport protocols
- Application protocols
- Network programming APIs (e.g., BSD Socket)
- Routing
