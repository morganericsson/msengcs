# 1DV011 - Embedded systems (5 hec)

## Prerequisites

- The student should know how to program in an object-oriented language
- The student should possess a basic knowledge about concurrent systems
- The student should know the basic hardware organization of a computer system
- The student should know the principles of operating systems and schedulers


## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course, the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Describe the main applications and reference architectures (CPU, bus, interfaces, etc.) for embedded systems and real-time control
2. Define the interface between hardware and software, and highlight related limitations and potential risks
3. Summarize how embedded operating systems are structured and work, especially regarding interruptions, processes, threads, and schedulers
4. Explain scheduling anomalies, their causes, and how to avoid/mitigate them

*2. Skills and abilities*

1. Use different methods to determine the schedulability of a periodic task set
2. Use efficiently languages and design environments for embedded systems
3. Design and implement embedded programs to control hardware devices, sensors and actuators
4. Implement exception and interrupt routines

*3. Judgement and approach*

1. Criticise the benefits and drawbacks for task schedulability approaches
2. Criticise the benefits and drawbacks for tasks synchronization approaches

## Course contents

- Introduction to control applications, embedded systems design, hardware and simulation environments.
- Sensors and actuators in embedded systems.
- Concept of time and time management. Monotonicity and non-monotonicity of time. Delays.
- Real-time operating systems. Scheduling of tasks. 
- Review of methods for preemptive scheduling.
- Synchronisation of tasks. Priority inversion, priority inheritance, priority ceiling. 
- Management of exceptions and interrupts. 

## Modules

1. Concepts, environment and principles for the design and implementation of embedded systems. 1.5 credits
2. Scheduling, management and synchronization of real-time tasks, and their implementation. 3.5 credits 

## Examination

The examination is based on: a [home] exam (E), 3 Assignments (A1, A2, A3) and a delivery of a practical project (P). 
- The exam is aimed at evaluating the knowledge and understanding of learning outcomes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, skill learning of outcome 2.1, and judgement learning of outcomes 3.1 and 3.2
- Assignment A1 will assess the skills learning of outcomes 2.1 and 2.2
- Assignment A2 will assess the skills learning of outcomes 2.1 and 2.3
- Assignment A3 will assess the skills learning of outcomes 2.1 and 2.4
- The practical project is aimed at assessing the skills specified in learning outcome 2.2, 2.3, and judgement learning specified in outcomes 3.1, 3.2

The examination is based on: 
- Module 1: Home Exam (E)
- Module 2: Project Development (A1,A2,A3,P)

## Grading

The course is assessed with the grades A, B, C, D, E, Fx or F. 
The grade A constitutes the highest grade on the scale and the remaining grades follow in descending order where the grade E is the lowest grade on the scale that will result in a pass. 
The grade F means that the student's performance is assessed as fail.
