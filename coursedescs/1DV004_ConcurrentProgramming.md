# 1DV004 - Concurrent programming (7.5 hec)

## Prerequisites

1DV001, 1DV003.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Describe problems related to shared resources, e.g., race conditions, locking, etc.
1. Explain some of the common locking mechanisms, e.g., semaphores, which guarantees they provide, and show that they do.
1. Reason about properties of concurrent programs, such as correctness and termination.
1. Explain the differences between shared memory and message passing.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Write concurrent programs in a shared memory environment, with threads and synchronization.
1. Design and implement concurrent versions of common algorithms and data structures.
1. Show that a (simple) concurrent program is correct.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Analyze a problem and implement a concurrent solution, using proper synchronization.
1. Based on the problem, determine whether shared memory or message passing is more suitable.
