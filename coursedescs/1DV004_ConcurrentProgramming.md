# 1DV004 - Concurrent programming (7.5 hec)

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills (1DV001)
- Basic data types as lists and arrays (1DV001) 
- Object oriented Programming in Java (1DV003)


## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Describe problems related to shared resources, e.g., race conditions, locking, starvation, etc.
2. Explain some of the common locking mechanisms, e.g., semaphores, which guarantees they provide, and show that they do.
3. Reason about properties of concurrent programs, such as correctness and termination.
4. Explain the differences between shared memory and message passing.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Write correct concurrent applications in a shared memory environment, with threads and synchronization.
2. Prove that a (simple) concurrent program is correct.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Analyze a problem and implement a suitable concurrent solution, using proper synchronization.
2. Based on the problem, determine whether shared memory or message passing is more suitable.

## Course contents

- Processes and synchronization
- Concurrent programming with threads and shared variables.
- Distributed algorithms
- Critical sections
- Locks, barriers, semaphores, and monitors.
- Message passing and multicast.
- Concurrent data structures

## Modules

- Practical Programming assignments - 3 credits (1 credit each)
- Written exam - 4.5 credits

## Types of instruction

The types of instruction for this course encompass: traditional theoretical lectures for teaching the conceptual part of concurrent programming and common challenges of concurrent execution of programs, lectures for teaching design and implementation aspects of concurrent systems in Java, and practical sessions to demonstrate the implementation and operation of concurrent applications. 

In addition, the content is exercised and deepened in context of practical lab assignments. All assignments are carried out individually or in fixed groups of maximal two students.



## Examination

The learning outcomes of this course are assessed with the help of a written exam (WE) to evaluate knowledge and understanding learning outcomes as well as some of the skills, and three practical assignments (PA) that evaluate the skills and judgement.
Skills that will be assessed by PA are the correct writing of concurrent programs and the design and implementation of concurrent algorithms using the concepts expounded in the contents of the course as critical sections, locks, barriers, semaphores and locks. 


## Grading

The course is assessed with an A-F grading. If one of the modules is failed, then final course grade is F. 

To pass a module, the student needs at least 50% of the points, otherwise the course is failed. The grading table is provided in the following:

|Final Grade (A-F) | Grading Points (%) |
| ---------------  | ------------------ |
| A                | >= 90              |
| B                | >= 80              |
| C                | >= 70              |
| D                | >= 60              |
| E                | >= 50              |

Each practical programming assignment will be graded with points. To pass the Practical Programming Assignment module, the average of points of the three assignments shall be at least 50%.

If both modules are passed, then the course is passed and the final course grade is an A-F grade based on a weighted average of 60% for the Written Exam and 40% for the Practical Programming Assignments. 

In order to relate the learning outcomes to the two assessment types and individual assignments, we provide the following table:

|  -   | WE  | PA1 | PA2 | PA3 |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1  | X   |     |     |     |
| 1.2  | X   | X   |     |     | 
| 1.3  | X   | X   |     |     |
| 1.4  | X   |     |     |     |
| 2.1  |     |     |  X  |  X  |
