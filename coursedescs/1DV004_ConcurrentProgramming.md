# [%PrelCode] - [%Name] ([%HEC] hec)

## Prerequisites

1DV001, 1DV003.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

- Describe problems related to shared resources, e.g., race conditions, locking, etc.
- Explain some of the common locking mechanisms, e.g., semaphores, which guarantees they provide, and show that they do.
- Reason about properties of concurrent programs, such as correctness and termination.
- Explain the differences between shared memory and message passing.

*2.	Skills and abilities*

- Write concurrent programs in a shared memory environment, with threads and synchronization.
- Design and implement concurrent versions of common algorithms and data structures.
- Show that a (simple) concurrent program is correct.

*3.	Judgement and approach*

- Analyze a problem and implement a concurrent solution, using proper synchronization.
- Based on the problem, determine whether shared memory or message passing is more suitable.

## Course contents
