# 4DV003 - MDE project (10 hec)

## Prerequisites

Object-oriented Programming in Java, UML, Software Engineering, Discrete mathematics, Software Architecture.

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Identify the complexities of software design and development in the domain of Model-Driven Engineering
2.  Classify and explain the principles and concepts underlying model-driven software engineering: models, metamodel, constraints, transformation, semantics, abstract and concrete syntax
3. Explain the architecture of contemporary modeling frameworks
4. Explain how domain specific modeling languages can be realized within a contemporary modeling framework 
5. Explain the basic concepts and techniques underlying automated software design and verification

*2. Skills and abilities*

1. Apply modelling in practice from requirements gathering to running software
2. Apply frameworks for model-driven software engineering, including the definition of meta-models for domain-specific modelling languages and the definition of UML profiles
3. Construct model editors within a modeling framework tool
4. Create model validators within a modeling framework
5. Specify model transformations, and realize them within a modeling framework

*3. Judgement and approach*

1. Reflect on the choice of Model-Driven Engineering methods used in the project

## Course contents

Models are primary artefacts in all engineering activities, and are used to analyze how things behave within specific areas of interest — e.g., mechanics, physics, and computing. Model-driven Engineering (MDE) is an emerging software engineering discipline which exploit models at all stages of the development process, from design to validation. Indeed, models are primary artefacts of the software development process while programs are mainly generated by means of automated model-to-code transformations. MDE is applicable across a wide range of domains such as cloud- and web-based services, networked embedded systems, mobile applications. This course introduces the core principles and concepts underlying MDE, and provides students with the state-of-the-art working knowledge, including:

- Foundation of Software Engineering and Modeling
- Model-Based Development, Model-Driven Engineering, Model-Driven Architecture
- UML, Modeling languages, Metamodeling, Profiling, Action languages, Domain-Specific Languages. Tool support for metamodeling. 
- Model transformations, model constraints. Tool support and standard QVT language for model transformations
- Model based testing
- Model validation
- Automated code generation

## Modules
1. State-of-the-art tools and methods for Model-Driven Engineering.
2. Development project in the domain of Model-Driven Engineering

## Types of instruction

## Examination
The examination is based on: 

- Module 1: Assignments (A1, A2)
- Module 2: Project Development (PD)
- Final: Home Exam (HE)

## Grading

The course is assessed with the grades A, B, C, D, E, Fx or F.
The grade A constitutes the highest grade on the scale and the remaining grades follow in descending order where the grade E is the lowest grade on the scale that will result in a pass.
The grade F means that the student’s performance is assessed as fail.
