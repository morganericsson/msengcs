## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student is expected to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*

1. Explain the fundamentals and describe the practice of deep learning
2. Describe methods for reinforcement learning, planning and control in sequential decision making processes
3. Explain the limitations of a model in a given setting


*2.	Skills and abilities*

1. Be able to implement deep learning algorithms in a state-of-the-art framework
2. Be able to apply relevant concepts from deep learning in order to solve practical problems, such as image recognition
3. Be able to represent data to facilitate learning

*3.	Judgement and approach*

1. Recognize typical effects of bad initialization, parameter and hyperparameter selection and suggest ways to improve the results.

## Grading
The course is assessed with the grades A, B, C, D, E, Fx or F.
The grade A constitutes the highest grade on the scale and the remaining grades follow in descending order where the grade E is the lowest grade on the scale that will result in a pass.
The grade F means that the student’s performance is assessed as fail.
