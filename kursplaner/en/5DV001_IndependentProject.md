## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Show significant knowledge within computer science or software engineering as well as insights into current research and development work, and
	2. show knowledge of methodology within computer science or software engineering.
*2.	Skills and abilities*
	1. With a holistic view, critically, independently and creatively identify, formulate and handle complex issues,
	2. formulate and critically evaluate, analyze and/or evaluate scientific questions, theories, and methods,
    3. Plan and adequately implement qualified tasks within the given framework and evaluate this work,
    4. participate in research and development work and thereby contribute to the development of knowledge,
    5. critically and systematically integrate knowledge, analyze, assess and manage complex phenomena, issues and situations, including limited information, and demonstrate the ability to model, simulate, predict and evaluate events, even with limited information, and
    6. orally and in writing clearly discuss their conclusions, as well as the underlying knowledge and the arguments.
*3.	Judgement and approach*
	1. Make assessments that take into account relevant scientific, social, and ethical aspects in the context of the specific independent project as well as show awareness of ethical aspects of research and development work,
    2. identify and analyze the role of science and engineering in society, as well
    3. Identify their need for further knowledge and to take responsibility for continually developing their knowledge and skills.

## Course contents

The course contents are decided for each student or pair of students in collaboration with supervisor and examiner. The independent project shall be done within computer science or software engineering.

## Types of instruction

The course consists of an independent project. For each student or pair of students, an examiner and one or more supervisors (e.g., if the project is conducted at a company) are appointed. The independent project is the finishing part of the education.

Every independent project is presented at a seminar. Each student shall act as opponent on another project and participate at three other presentations on the same level or higher. Participation on three other projects must be completed before the own project is presented.

Attendance at the students own presentation and opposition is mandatory.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`RAP1`| Report and presentation  | A-F   | 27    |  
|`OPP1`| Opposition            | G-U   | 1.5   |  
|`ASK1`| Participation at three other presentations           | G-U   | 1.5   | 

To pass the course, grade G is required on `OPP1` and `ASK1` and at least grade E is required on `RAP1`. The final grade is decided from `RAP1`.

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

| Outcome |`RAP1` |`OPP1` |`ASK1` |
| :--------- | :---: | :---: | :---: |

| 3.3        | **X** | **X** | **X** |
## Reading list

The student is expected to find suitable literature independently or together with the supervisor.

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
