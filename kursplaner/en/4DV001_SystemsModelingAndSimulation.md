| --- | --- | 
| *Main field of study*: | Computer Science | 
| *Progression*: | A1N | 

## Prerequisites

- 1DV004 - Objektorienterad programmering 
- 1MA004 - Tillämpad sannolikhetslära och statistik
- 1MA006 - Numeriska metoder

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Explain fundamental concepts within modeling and simulation, and
	2. describe different classes of simulations, e.g., event-based, and when these should be applied.
2. *Competence and skills*
	1. Implement simple simulations from selected classes, such as event-based, continuous, and agent based,
	2. implement suitable deterministic and non-deterministic models in a tool used to simulate systems, and
	3. given a problem, determine a suitable simulation method.
3. *Judgement and approach*
	1. Reflect on the suitability of different models for different types of problems as well as which consequences an unsuitable model might have,
	2. value the result of a simulation, e.g., with respect to performance or reliability, and
	3. reflect on the importance of being able to simulate system before they are constructed and which benefits that might have for society. 

## Course contents

The course gives an overview of different deterministic and non-deterministic modeling and simulation techniques.

The following topics are covered:

- Introduction to modeling and simulation.
- How are models and simulations used?
- Event-driven simulation.
- Continuous simulation.
- Queuing theory
- Agent-based modeling and simulation.
- Non-deterministic and stochastic modeling and simulation.
- Sampling methods.
- Monte Carlo-simulation.
- Validation of simulations, hypothesis testing, and rare events.
- Tools and frameworks for modeling and simulation, e.g., Simulink and Modelica.

## Types of instruction

The instruction consists of lectures, seminars, and teacher-supervised laboratory sessions. The course also contains a series of guest lectures where representatives from industry and research discusses how and why they use simulations in their work.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`LAB1`| Programming assignments | A-F   | 2.5   |
|`HEM1`| Take-home exam           | A-F   | 2.5   |

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `HEM1`(50%) and `LAB1`(50%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

| Outcome    |`LAB1` |`HEM1` |
| :--------- | :---: | :---: |
| 1.1        |       | **X** |
| 1.2        |       | **X** |
| 2.1        | **X** |       |
| 2.2        | **X** |       |
| 2.3        | **X** | **X** |
| 3.1        |       | **X** |
| 3.2        | **X** | **X** |
| 3.3        |       | **X** |

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
