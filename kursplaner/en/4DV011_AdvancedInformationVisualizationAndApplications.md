## Learning outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Define and explain visualization techniques (regarding interaction and visual representation) and example tools for special data sets and applications domains,
	2. describe validation and evaluation methods for information visualization tools and approaches, and
	3. describe the most important challenges in the field.
*2. Skills and abilities*
	1. Represent data by expressive and effective visualizations using state-of-the-art methods, software, and tools, and
	2. implement new interactive visualizations for more complex and larger data sets; where required with a focus on specific application domains or analysis problems.
*3. Judgement and approach*
	1. Critically reflect on the discussed visualization and interaction approaches in the light of current theories and research, and
	2. make well-grounded design choices in the context of various tasks and data constraints.

## Course contents

The course extends Information Visualization 1 (4DV010) with interactive visualization techniques and systems for special data sets, such as network data, time-dependent data, and text data. Furthermore, we discuss specific applications where information visualizations are used to analyze/explore domain-specific dataâ€”e.g., in bioinformatics, geography, software development, etc. The course also reviews possibilities on how visualizations can be validated, evaluated, or used in non-standard contexts like collaborative settings or personal data analysis.

The following topics are covered:

- Visualization techniques and drawing conventions for trees/hierarchies, general  network data (graphs), and multivariate/dynamic networks.
- Visualization techniques for text data and document collections (corpora).
- Visualization techniques for general time series data.
- Visualizations for specific application domains including an overview of their usual analysis tasks and data specifics.
- Collaborative and personal visualization ideas and approaches.
- Validating and evaluating visualizations.
- The most important unsolved information visualization challenges.

## Types of instruction

The instruction consists of lectures, seminars, and teacher-supervised laboratory sessions. 

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`PRJ1`| Programming project | A-F   | 2     |
|`PRS1`| Oral presentation          | A-F   | 1     |
|`MUN1`| Oral exam      | A-F   | 2     |

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `PRJ1` (40%), `PRS1` (20%), and `MUN1` (40%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

| Outcome       |`PRJ1` |`PRS1` |`MUN1` |  
| ---------------- | ----  | ----  | ----  |  
| 1.1              |       | **X** | **X** |  
| 1.2              | **X** |       | **X** |  
| 1.3              | **X** |       | **X** |  
| 2.1              | **X** |       |       |  
| 2.2              | **X** |       |       |  
| 3.1              | **X** | **X** | **X** |  
| 3.2              | **X** |       | **X** |

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
