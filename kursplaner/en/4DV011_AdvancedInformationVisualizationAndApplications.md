## Course contents

This course extends Information Visualization 1 (4DV010) with interactive visualization techniques and systems for special data sets, such as network data, time-dependent data, and text data. Furthermore, we discuss specific applications where information visualizations are used to analyze/explore domain-specific data—e.g., in bioinformatics, geography, software development, etc.—and review example approaches for the interactive visualization of such data sets. Finally, the course reviews possibilities on how visualizations can be validated, evaluated, or used in non-standard contexts like collaborative settings or personal data analysis. Covered topics are:

* Visualization techniques and drawing conventions for trees/hierarchies, general  network data (graphs), and multivariate/dynamic networks
* Visualization techniques for text data and document collections (corpora)
* Visualization techniques for general time series data
* Visualizations for specific application domains including an overview of their usual analysis tasks and data specifics
* Collaborative and personal visualization ideas and approaches
* Validating and evaluating visualizations
* Most important unsolved information visualization challenges

## Types of instruction

The types of instruction for this course encompass traditional lectures for teaching the majority of the course content. In addition, the content is exercised and deepened in context of conceptual and practical assignments. All assignments will be also discussed in a seminar setting where all students present their results and receive feedback from their fellow students and instructor. This setting also provides a place to critically reflect on information visualizations based on theories and research results presented in the lectures. All assignments and presentations are carried out individually or in fixed groups of maximal two students.

## Modules

* Presentation, 1 credit
* Programming project, 2 credits
* Oral exam, 2 credits

## Examination

The learning outcomes of this course are assessed with the help of 3 practical assignments (A1-A3) that together form a small programming project, a presentation (P) given by the student or student group, and an oral exam (OE) for each student individually at the end of the course. The oral exam will take 30 minutes and is used to mainly evaluate knowledge and conceptual understanding of the visualization concepts and fundamentals teached in the lectures. The exam also encompasses higher level questions in order to assess if the students are able to critically reflect upon the discussed visualization and interaction approaches. In addition, the assignments are used to mainly evaluate the students’ skills to implement new interactive visualizations for more complex and larger data sets as well as making well-grounded design choices in the context of specific tasks and example data sets. As part of the last assignment, the students have to provide a detailed proposal of how their finally implemented visualization should be evaluated. Lastly, the presentation shall show if students are able to critically reflect on visualization and interaction approaches in the light of current theories and research. For this, a specific topic (e.g., a research paper) is assigned to each student/group, based on which they have to prepare a talk on the topic and critically discuss the topic in a seminar-like setting.
We only use programming libraries (e.g., D3 [1]) that are freely available in general or for classroom use. Any standard laptop or desktop computer with an onboard graphics chip and/or dedicated graphics card is sufficient for the programming/visualization tasks. Passing the complete assignments and presentation module is the prerequisite for doing the oral exam.

## Grading

The complete course is assessed with an A-F grading. The three modules are separately evaluated and graded, but by using a different grading scheme and under the condition that the assignments and presentation modules both must be passed to be able to attend the oral exam.
An individual assignment is passed if all tasks for this assignment are sufficiently solved following a three-level grading scheme: F (failed), P (passed), and P* (passed with distinction). P* is given for exceptionally good assignments with respect to clarity/precision of the answers and/or outstanding implementations/visualizations clearly above the average of the assignments submissions. The grade for the entire assignments module is the average of the grades of the individual assignments, but each of them must be passed at least.
The student presentation is evaluated with the same three-level grading scheme: F, P, P*. Basis for the grading are the prepared slides, presentation style, ability to answer questions on the topic, and ability to critically reflect on the topic.
The oral exam is assessed with an A-F grading. If the student finally fails the assignments/presentation modules or the oral exam, then the final grade for the complete course is F. In all other cases, the final course grade is equal to the grade of the oral exam. A P* grade in the assignments/presentation module can be used to elevate the oral exam grade by maximal one level. The grading table for the oral exam is provided in the following:

| Final Grade (A-F) | Grading Criteria   |
|-------------------|--------------------|
|  A                |  sustained level of superior performance demonstrated in all learning outcomes (LO1-3) |
|  B                |  consistent level of performance that is clearly above average in the vast majority of the learning outcomes (LO1-3) |
|  C                |  performance that is generally average and most learning outcomes are achieved (LO1-3) |
|  D                |  below average performance and achievement of the learning outcomes (LO1-2) |
|  E                | minimal performance and achievement of the learning outcomes (LO1-2) |

The oral exam is performed in English. For this, a conversation between the student and the examiner must be possible, but the language capabilities (grammar, vocabulary used, etc.) have no influence on the final grade.

In order to relate the learning outcomes to the two assessment types and individual assignments, we provide the following table:

| Learning Outcome | Assessment Type | P   | A1  | A2  | A3  | Oral Exam |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --------- |
| 1.1              | P + OE          |**X**|     |     |     | **X**     |
| 1.2              | A + OE          |     |     |     |**X**| **X**     |
| 1.3              | OE              |     |     |     |     | **X**     |
| 2.1              | A               |     |**X**|     |**X**|           |
| 2.2              | A               |     |     |**X**|**X**|           |
| 3.1              | P + OE          |**X**|     |     |     | **X**     |
| 3.2              | A + OE          |     |     |**X**|     | **X**     |

Late work will not be accepted without prior approval by the instructor. Reasons for accepted delays may be proven health conditions, no-fault hardships, etc.
