	2. explain fundamental principles and applications of machine learning, 
	3. explain benefits and drawbacks of different machine learning techniques/algorithms, and
	4. explain different learning paradigms in machine learning.
*2.	Skills and abilities*
	1. Implement algorithms to solve typical machine learning tasks, 
	2. represent data to facilitate machine learning,
	3. select an appropriate model for a task and evaluate its performance, and
	4. recognize the effects of bad initialization and parameter selection as well as over- and underfitting.
*3.	Judgement and approach*
	1. Reason about the effects that, e.g., bias in the training data can have on actual applications.

## Course contents

The course gives an overview of fundamental concepts and techniques within machine learning.

The following topics are covered:

- An overview of artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Fundamental principles for machine learning
- Data preprocessing, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction
- Model selection, generalization, overfitting 
- Optimization of training models
- Regression
- Nearest neighbor classifiers
- Logistic regression
- Naive bayes
- Decision trees
- Artificial neural networks
- Ensemble methods
- Kernel methods and Support vector machines
- k-means and hierarchical clustering

## Types of instruction

The instruction consists of lectures, seminars, and teacher-supervised laboratory sessions. 

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`TEN1`| Written exam   | A-F   | 2.5   |
|`LAB1`| Programming assignments | A-F   | 2.5   |

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `TEN1`(50%) and `LAB1`(50%).

## Grading

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

| Outcome |`TEN1` |`LAB1` |
| :--------- | :---: | :---: |
| 1.1        | **X** |       |
| 1.2        | **X** |       |
| 1.3        | **X** | **X** |
| 1.4        | **X** |       |
| 2.1        |       | **X** |
| 2.2        | **X** | **X** |
| 2.3        | **X** | **X** |
| 2.4        | **X** | **X** |
| 2.5        | **X** | **X** |
| 3.1        | **X** |       |

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
