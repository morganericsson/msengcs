## Learning outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Characterize the role of machine learning in a software system and how it can be integrated in the structure of such systems,
	2. enumerate which properties a tool or software library should have to be applied to a given problem, and
	3. name and explain the most common problems when attempting to use unprocessed data in machine learning.
*2. Skills and abilities*
	1. Independently learn different tools, methods, and software libraries used within machine learning,
	2. elicit requirements from a customer and based on these determine which data is needed and which machine learning techniques that is most suitable,
	3. from a set of customer requirements define metrics that can be used to evaluate how well a machine learning model performs,
	4. implement and evaluate a system with a machine learning component,
	5. prioritize functionality and continuously release new functionality to customers, and
	6. ensure that the system is operational.
*3.	Judgement and approach*
	1. Critically reflect on the result of a project and how well it fulfills the customer requirements with respect to, e.g., technology used, architecture (software and hardware), data, metrics, etc, and
	2. critically reflect on how agile and Lean were used throughout the project with respect to, e.g., work environment.

## Course contents

The course is a project course that, given a realistic problem and settings, considers the entire CDIO (Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate) cycle. The students are placed in the role of a small development team within an agile startup that should develop a data-driven product. 

The students are expected to work using agile processes in teams of 5-7 and are expected to perform all roles except product owner. The startup environment requires fast releases and effective use of available resources focus is put on Lean agile as well as applied machine learning and data processing.

- How machine learning projects are structured and implemented.
- Tools, services, and libraries that are used for data analysis and machine learning, e.g., Weka and Tensorflow.
- Configuration of pipelines for machine learning systems with respect to software ang hardware, e.g., accelerators.
- The practice of working with real data with respect to, e.g., collection, processing, and analysis.
- Evaluation of performance based on customer requirements.
- Experiment-driven development with short design, training, and evaluation cycles.
- The Lean strategy for production and the Toyota production system.
- How Lean-Agile combines the ideas from Lean with agile processes.
- What is waste in software development and how can it be reduced?
- How can just-in-time-production be applied to software development?
- How can a team learn, for example from reflection after a spring and how can the process highlight the development team (and their competences).
- Software as something complete.
- Advanced skills in writing reflection reports.

## Types of instructions

The instruction consists of lectures and supervision meetings. The lectures present the project as well as the tools, methods, and resources that the students are expected to use. The students will have regular supervision meetings with a teacher during the project. T

All projects will be presented at a seminar at the end of the course.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`UPG1`| Vision and planning documents            | A-F   | 2     |  
|`PRJ1`| Project work (incl. deliverables)       | A-F   | 5     |  
|`RAP1`| Reflection report - Choices and outcomes | A-F   | 1     |  
|`RAP2`| Reflection report - Lean               | A-F   | 1     |  
|`PRS1`| Design, implementation, and result      | A-F   | 1     |  

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `HEM1`(50%), and `LAB1`(50%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

## Reading list

The students are expected to find suitable literature on their own. The list below can be used as a starting point.

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
