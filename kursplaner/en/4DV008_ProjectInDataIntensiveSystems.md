2. Identify characteristics of state-of-the-art machine learning systems

*2. Skills and abilities*

1. Plan and execute a machine learning project that involves data pre-processing, algorithm selection, and metrics for validating results
2. Execute the project plan by applying previously learned skills from machine learning courses and other relevant courses in a project-like environment and combining them with state-of-the-art machine learning tools and libraries

*3.	Judgement and approach*

2. Evaluate whether the proposed solution reaches its goals efficiently and effectively

## Course contents

This course offers the students the opportunity to consolidate and apply knowledge and skills obtained in previous courses of their studies by the development of a machine learning 
application. 
Machine learning systems learn patterns from labeled or unlabeled data, and aim to provide end-users with tools to aid in finding similar patterns and understanding newly collected data. 
By following the course’s modules (described in more details below) the students will be introduced to theoretical machine learning aspects and tools, 
create the conceptual design of a machine learning project of their choice, implement their designs, and present their results.

## Modules

M1: Machine learning systems – theory and practice, 2 credits

The course starts with an introduction to machine learning systems from both theoretical and practical perspectives with the following activities:

- Lecture(s) on the role of machine learning systems for real-world tasks
- Analysis of selected examples of state-of-the-art machine learning systems
- Tutorial(s) on state-of-the-art tools, APIs and libraries used for the development of machine learning systems, such as Weka [1] and TensorFlow [2]

[2] https://www.tensorflow.org

M2: Conceptual design of the project, 3 credits

The main goal of the students during M2 is to use the knowledge obtained in M1 and previous relevant courses to design a machine learning system. The design shall outline approaches for data 
collection or data selection, data pre-processing, algorithm selection and result metrics selection, and finally what to learn from the data.

M3: Implementation of the project, 5 credits

Finally, in M3 the students will implement the design proposed in M2 by using selected programming languages, APIs, libraries and tools.

## Types of instructions

The types of instruction for this course encompass different categories. Traditional lectures are used for teaching fundamental concepts, complemented with more practical 
tutorial sessions for the introduction of specific programming libraries. The project-related activities will mainly consist of self studies and group activities which will be regularly accompanied 
by the responsible for the course.

## Examination

M1: The student’s progress in this module will be assessed with a theoretical assignment where the student describes and analyses a state-of-the-art machine learning system of their own choice.

M2: The examination in this module is the report describing the design of the machine learning project. The main assessment criteria for the design are correct choice of pre-processing techniques, 
algorithm and validation metrics to approach the task.

M3: The examination in this module is project deliverables (source code, binary, and documentation). The main assessment criteria for the implementation are as follows:
- Effectiveness of the developed system in solving the task
- Quality of project deliverables, especially the documentation of the source code and the system’s usage
- Ability of the student to reflect and critically analyze the development process by comparing the initial design from M2 and the final result

The examination is based on: 

- M1: Theoretical Assignment (TA)
- M2: Project Design (DE)
- M3: Project Deliverable (PD) 

|  -   | TA  | DE  | PD  |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- | 
| 1.1  | X   | X   |     | 
| 1.2  | X   | X   |     | 
| 2.1  |     | X   | X   | 
| 2.2  |     |     | X   | 
| 3.1  |     | X   | X   | 
| 3.2  |     |     | X   | 

## Grading

The course is assessed with an A-F grading. The three modules are separately evaluated and graded. Each of the assignments in the three modules (TA, DE, PD) must be passed individually, 
i.e., grade(Assignment) ≥ 50% in order to pass it. The grades for each module are calculated as follows:

- grade(M1) = grade(TA)
- grade(M2) = grade(DE)
- grade(M3) = grade(PD)

If one of the modules is failed then the final course grade is F. If all modules are passed, the final course grade is based on the weighted average of the grades 
received for the three modules, as follows: grade(Course) = 0.2 * grade(M1) + 0.3 * grade(M2) + 0.5 * grade(M3).

If grade(Course) ≥ 50%, then the student passes the course, otherwise the course is failed. The grading table is provided in the following:

|Final Grade (A-F) | Grading Points (%) |
| ---------------  | ------------------ |
| A                | >= 90              |
| B                | >= 80              |
| C                | >= 70              |
| D                | >= 60              |
| E                | >= 50              |
