## Learning outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Classify typical user tasks for visualizations,
	2. define and explain the visualization techniques (regarding interaction and visual representation) and example tools discussed in the course, and
	3. recall and explain the fundamental perceptual principles that have influence on information visualization
*2. Skills and abilities*
	1. Represent data by expressive and effective visualizations using state-of-the-art methods, software, and tools, and
	2. implement basic interactive visualizations, such as scatter plots or star plots
*3. Judgement and approach*
	1. Critically reflect on visualization and interaction approaches in the light of current theories and research, and
	2. make well-grounded design choices in the context of various tasks and data constraints

## Course contents

Information visualization centers on abstract information that does not have a physical or geometric correspondence to the real world. Examples of such abstract data are symbolic, tabular, networked, hierarchical, or textual information sources. The course provides an overview of the most common information visualization techniques and their application.

- Definition of the field of information visualization and relationships to related fields such as human-computer interaction or scientific visualization
- Basics in visual perception (preattentive processing, Gestalt laws) and cognition
- Data and visualization foundations and processing
- Task abstractions and taxonomies
- Interaction concepts and techniques (e.g., dynamic queries, zoom and pan, or focus and context)
- Visualization techniques for 1D, 2D, 3D, and multidimensional data
- Overview of current systems and toolkits for information visualization

## Types of instruction

The instruction consists of lectures, seminars, and teacher-supervised laboratory sessions. 

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`UPG1`| Practical/theoretical assignments   | A-F   | 3     |
|`MUN1`| Oral exam     | A-F   | 2     |

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `HEM1`(50%) and `UPG1`(50%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
