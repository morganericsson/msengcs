## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Describe the research state of the art within an area of computer science or software engineering in great detail, and
	2. describe research directions, positions, and the most common research methods within an area of computer science or software engineering.
*2.	Skills and abilities*
	1. Independently plan a research project within computer science of software engineering with relevant research questions and suitable methods, 
	2. find, critically assess, and present scientific results, and
	3. critically asses the choice of method and its use in a scientific study.
*3.	Judgement and approach*
	1. Analyze how the results of a scientific study increase our understanding and knowledge of a phenomenon or similar,
	2. reason about how a scientific study contributes to society and technological development, e.g., how the results can be used by or transfered to the software industry, and
	3. reason about ethical considerations and analyze how they are managed in a study.

## Course contents

The course consists of a seminar series where students present and discuss scientific articles to advance their understanding of current research within computer science and software engineering, and their ability to critically evaluate and discuss research methodology and results.

- Scientific methods withing computer science and software engineering, with a focus on a by the student selected area.
- Academic writing and oral presentation.
- Critical analysis of scientific articles and presentations.
- How to plan a research project.
- Ethical considerations and these are handled. 

## Types of instruction

The instruction consists of a small series of lectures that introduces the course structure and required theory as well as a seminar series where students present and discuss scientific articles together with researchers within the field. The teacher will, if needed, guide the discussion so that all relevant topics are addressed, e.g., ethical considerations.

The project plan is produced together with a researcher (that will act as the thesis supervisor).

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`PRS1`| Presentation of scientific articles      | A-F   | 1     |  
|`OPP1`| Opposition         | A-F   | 1     |  
|`UPG1`| Project plan                          | A-F   | 3     |  

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `PRS1` (20%), `OPP1` (20%), and `UPG1` (60%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

| Outcome |`PRS1` |`OPP1` |`UPG1` |
| :--------- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.1        | **X** |       | **X** |
| 1.2        |       |       | **X** |
| 2.1        |       |       | **X** |
| 2.2        | **X** | **X** | **X** |
| 2.3        |       | **X** | **X** |
| 3.1        | **X** |       | **X** |
| 3.2        | **X** |       | **X** |
| 3.3        |       | **X** | **X** |

## Reading list

The require readings are decided together with supervisor and should consist of scientific articles and books that can either be downloaded or are available from the university library (or the supervisor's library)

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
