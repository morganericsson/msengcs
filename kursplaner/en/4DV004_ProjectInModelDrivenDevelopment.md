## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Classify and explain key principles and concepts within model-based development, such as models, meta-models, constraints, transformations, semantics, and abstract and concrete syntax, and
	2. describe the architecture of current modeling frameworks as well as how domain specific modeling frameworks can be formulated using these.
*2. Skills and abilities*
	1. Independently learn how to use different frameworks and tools for model-based development, 
	2. implement a system that fulfills a set of requirements that were elicited from a customer,
	3. given a set of models and framework, create model editors, model checks, and model transformations,
	4. use model-based development to implement an executable software program and verify its properties, and
	5. plan an agile project, including requirements elicitation, prioritization, and time estimation. 
*3. Judgement and approach*
	1. Critically reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of model-based development from a software engineering perspective, e.g., the time different tasks takes, how easy the tools are to use, etc, 
	2. reason about the benefits and drawbacks of model-based development from a societal perspective, e.g., with respect to security and safety requirements, economic benefits, etc., and
	3. analyze how well the agile way of working worked within a project from a working environment perspective and suggest improvements.

## Course contents

The course is a project course that, given a realistic problem and settings, considers the entire CDIO (Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate) cycle. The students are placed in the role of a development team within an agile organization with many requirements on their software.

The students are expected to work using agile processes in teams of 5-7 and are expected to perform all roles except product owner. Special focus is given on requirements elicitation, description, planning, and estimation from an agile perspective as well as documentation. 

- Advanced models and software development.
- Model-based development and architecture.
- Software problems, such as security, performance, and stability.
- Software for different domains, and the difference in requirements.
- The benefits and drawbacks of model-driven development.
- Modeling languages, meta-modeling, and profiles.
- Model transformations and model constraints.
- Action languages.
- Domain specific languages.
- Model-based testing.
- Model validation.
- Code generation from models.
- Tools for model-based development.
- Methods to estimate time in agile projects.
- Methods to elicit and document requirements
- Methods to document software in agile projects and the relationship between documentation, models, and source code.
- How to write reflection reports and post-mortem analyses of completed projects.

## Types of instruction

The instruction consists of lectures and supervision meetings. The lectures present the project as well as the tools, methods, and resources that the students are expected to use. The students will have regular supervision meetings with a teacher during the project.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :--------------------------------------       | :---: | :---: |  
|`UPG1`| Vision och planeringsdokument                 | A-F   | 2     |  
|`PRJ1`| Projektarbete (inkl. leverabler)              | A-F   | 5     |  
|`RAP1`| Reflektionsrapport - Modellbaserad utveckling | A-F   | 1     |  
|`RAP2`| Reflektionsrapport - Projektarbete            | A-F   | 1     |  
|`PRS1`| Design, implementering och resultat           | A-F   | 1     |  

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from:`UPG1`(20%),`PRJ1`(50%),`RAP1`(10%),`RAP2`(10%), and `PRS1`(10%).

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
