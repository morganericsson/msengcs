## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Describe the different phases in the compilation process, 
	2. describe different parsing techniques, 
	3. explain what happens during semantic analysis, 
	4. explain how type systems for common programming languages work, and
	5. explain how a stack machine works.
*2. Skills and abilities*
	1. Design finite automata-based lexical analysis and an LL(1) parser for a simple programming language, 
	2. design and develop a semantic analysis that includes error handling and simple type inference, and that decorates the syntax tree with type information, 
	3. implement a parser using a given parser generator, and
	4. design and develop a stack足-based virtual machine.
*3. Judgement and approach*
	1. Judge the difficulty of implementing various programming language constructs, and
	2. select an appropriate formal notation to describe a given formal language.

## Course contents

The course presents techniques, theories, and tools used to constructing a compiler. The course also discusses how these ideas can be used to define and interpret domain-specific languages within model-driven software engineering. As a result, the course focuses on the 
compiler front-end and runtime interpretation of intermediate program representations.

- Different compilation phases
- Object足-oriented compiler design
- Lexical analysis based on finite automata and regular languages 
- Context足-free grammars and languages
- Different parsing techniques for context-free languages
- Type systems and type inference
- Attributed grammars
- Semantic analysis
- Intermediate program representations
- Code generation
- Stack足-based execution

## Types of instruction

The types of instruction for this course encompass traditional lectures for teaching the majority of the course content. In addition, the content is exercised and deepened in context of tutoring sessions related to the practical and written assignments. The written assignments are carried out individually, the practical assignments are carried out in groups of two students.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`UPG1`| Theoretical assignments   | A-F   | 1     |
|`LAB1`| Programming assignments | A-F   | 2     |
|`TEN1`| Written exam   | A-F   | 2     |

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from:`UPG1`(20%),`LAB1`(40%) och`TEN1`(40%). 

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
