## Learning outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Explain and motivate information visualization and visual analytics in a man-machine perspective as well as how these areas facilitate data analysis,
*2. Skills and abilities*
	1. Independently organize and carry out an agile project,
	2. independently learn to use tools, methods, and software libraries used within information visualization and visual analytics,
	3. elicit requirements/tasks from an analyst and based on these decide which visualizations, data analyses, and interaction methods are most suitable,
	4. implement a visual analytics system using reasonable technical solutions and deploy this, and
	5. based on analyst requirements/tasks define and perform evaluations of a visual analytics system.
*3. Judgement and approach*
	1. Reflect on which types of questions and analysis processes are best supported by different combinations of visualization techniques, 
	2. reflect on how the choice of visualizations is affected by the groups of people that will use the system with respect to, e.g., metaphors and common understanding, and
	3. reflect on the bias that exists in the system based on collected data, data processing, analysis methods, and visualization techniques.

## Course contents

The course is a project course that, given a realistic problem and settings, considers the entire CDIO (Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate) cycle. The students are expected to work using agile processes in teams of 5-7 and are expected to perform all roles except product owner. This is the final project course, so the students are expected to independently manage an agile project.

- The importance of data and visualization for an organization.
- Information visualization in realistic projects.
- Data analysis and processing in realistic projects.
- Tools, services, and software libraries that can be used for data analysis and to develop information visualizations, e.g., D3, yFiles, and Bokeh.
- Man, machine, and visualization. 
- How visualizations are evaluated in realistic projects.
- How to design accessible visualization systems.
- Bias in data, analysis, and visualization.
- Metaphors, how and when should they be used, what cultural connections to they have, etc.

## Types of instruction

The instruction consists of lectures and supervision meetings. The lectures present the project as well as the tools, methods, and resources that the students are expected to use. The students will have regular supervision meetings with a teacher during the project.

All projects will be presented at a seminar at the end of the course.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :--------------------------------------          | :---: | :---: |  
|`UPG1`| Vision and planning documents                   | A-F   | 2     |  
|`PRJ1`| Project work (incl. deliverables)                 | A-F   | 5     |  
|`RAP1`| Reflection report - To manage an agile project | A-F   | 1     |  
|`RAP2`| Reflection report - Human and machine        | A-F   | 1     |  
|`PRS1`| Design, implementation, and result             | A-F   | 1     |  

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `UPG1` (20%), `PRJ1` (50%), `RAP1` (10%), `RAP2` (10%), and `PRS1` (10%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

| Outcome |`UPG1` |`PRJ1` |`RAP1` |`RAP2` |`PRS1` |

## Reading list

The students are expected to find suitable literature on their own. The list below can be used as a starting point.

- Keim, D., Kohlhammer, J., Ellis, G. and Mansmann, F., *Mastering the Information Age: Solving Problems with Visual Analytics*, Eurographics, 2010.
- Munzner, T., *Visualization Analysis and Design*, CRC Press, 2014. 
- Purchase, H. C., *Experimental Human-Computer Interaction: A Practical Guide with Visual Examples*, Cambridge University Press, 2012. 

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
