| *Progression*: | A1N | 

## Prerequisites

- 1DV006 - Algoritmer
- 4DV006 - Parallelldatorprogrammering
- 4DV005 - Maskininlärning
- 1MA002 - Linjär algebra
- 1MA003 - Envariabelanalys 1

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Describe fundamental concepts and principles for data mining, e.g., distance measures and clustering, and
	2. explain the state of the art of data mining with respect to techniques and applications.
*2.	Skills and abilities*
	1. Given a problem and a data set or stream, plan and design a data mining pipeline with respect to what methods should be used for, e.g., dimensionality reduction, distance measure, and clustering, as well as reason about the resulting data quality, 
	2. implement some of the algorithms, e.g., Page rank and CURE clustering in an efficient way, e.g., using a map reduce framework, and
	3. use suitable tools to extract data from a given (unstructured) data set or stream.
*3.	Judgement and approach*
	1. Reflect on data mining from a societal perspective with respect to ethics and value, and
	2. reason about data quality and what effect it has on the extracted data as well as how the data quality of the input data can be improved and what the value of such an improvement would be.

## Course contents

The course provides an introduction to data mining and its applications, for example search engines, recommender systems, and web advertisements. 

The following topics are covered:

- Introduction to data mining.
- The relationship between data mining and machine learning.
- Extraction of information from text.
- How to find similar things, e.g., documents.
- How data can be extracted from streams.
- Link analysis, e.g., Page rank and HITS.
- Analysis of common sets, e.g., Market-Basket and the A-priori algorithm
- Clustering algorithms, e.g., CURE and CRGPF.
- Dimensionality reduction, e.g., CUR.
- Clustering of data streams.
- Application on the web, recommendation systems, and social network analysis.
- Data mining from a societal perspective with respect to, e.g., ethical questions, business value, and health.
- Data quality.
- Tools and software libraries for data mining.

## Types of Instruction

The instruction consists of lectures, seminars, and teacher-supervised laboratory sessions. The course also contains a series of guest lectures where representatives from industry and research discusses how and why they use data mining in their work.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`MUN1`| Oral exam        | A-F   | 2     |  
|`LAB1`| Programming assignments | A-F   | 2     |  
|`UPG1`| Reflection report      | A-F   | 1     |  

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `MUN1` (40%), `LAB1` (40%) och `UPG1` (20%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
