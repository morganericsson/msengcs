## Prerequisites

- 1DV006 - Algoritmer

## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Describe fundamental concepts and principles for data mining, e.g., distance measures and clustering, and
	2. explain the state of the art of data mining with respect to techniques and applications.
*2.	Skills and abilities*
	1. Given a problem and a data set or stream, plan and design a data mining pipeline with respect to what methods should be used for, e.g., dimensionality reduction, distance measure, and clustering, as well as reason about the resulting data quality, 
	2. implement some of the algorithms, e.g., MDS and DBSCAN clustering in an efficient way, and
	3. use suitable tools to extract data from a given (unstructured) data set or stream.
*3.	Judgement and approach*
	1. Reflect on data mining from a societal perspective with respect to ethics and value, and
	2. reason about data quality and what effect it has on the extracted data, as well as how the data quality of the input data can be improved and what the value of such an improvement would be.

## Course contents

The course provides an introduction to data mining and its applications, for example search engines, recommender systems, and text mining. 

The following topics are covered:

- Introduction to data mining.
- The relationship between data mining and machine learning.
- How to find similar things, e.g., documents, images.
- How to extract structured data from streams.
- Link analysis, e.g., PageRank and HITS.
- Clustering algorithms, e.g., EM, Affinity Propagation.
- Dimensionality reduction, e.g., t-SNE, Self-Organizing Maps.
- Mining of data streams.
- Applications on the web, e.g., recommendation systems, social network analysis.
- Extraction of information from text.
- Data mining from a societal perspective with respect to, e.g., ethical questions, business value, and health.
- Data quality.
- Tools and software libraries for data mining.

## Types of Instruction

The instruction consists of lectures, seminars, and teacher-supervised laboratory sessions. The course also includes guest lectures where representatives from academia and industry discuss how and why they use data mining in their work.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name                    | Grade | HEC   | 
| :--- | :---------------------: | :---: | :---: |
|`PRJ1`| Programming Project     | A-F   | 2     |  
|`MUN1`| Oral exam               | A-F   | 1     |    
|`LAB1`| Programming assignments | A-F   | 1     |
|`UPG1`| Reflection report       | A-F   | 1     |  

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `PRJ1` (40%), `MUN1` (20%), `LAB1` (20%), and `UPG1` (20%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

| Outcome    |`PRJ1` |`MUN1` |`LAB1` |`UPG1` |

## Reading list

Required reading:

- Leskovec, J., Rajaraman, A., and Ullman, J. D., *Mining of Massive Datasets*, Cambridge University Press, 2014. Pages: 400 of 511.
- Compendium of scientific articles.

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
