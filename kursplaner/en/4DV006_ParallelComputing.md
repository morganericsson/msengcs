## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Explain the main similarities and differences between concurrent and parallel programs,
	2. describe different types of parallel computers and accelerators, and reason about which type is best for a given problem, and
	3. describe the state of the art of parallel computer and accelerators as well as how these are programmed.
*2.	Skills and abilities*
	1. Decompose a problem, formulate a parallel algorithm to solve it, and implement it on a parallel computer and accelerator using, e.g., OpenMP, CUDA, or MPI, 
	2. plan and deploy a (virtual) cluster and software (e.g., MPI) for solve a specific type of problem,
	3. given a problem and an implementation, reason about expected performance and ways to increase it.
*3.	Judgement and approach*
	1. Reflect on the cost of solving certain types of problems, e.g., with respect to economic costs and energy/environmental costs, as well as how these are impacted by the choice of architecture, algorithm, etc.

## Course contents

The course advances the students knowledge of how problems can be solved by parallel processing and accelerators (e.g., graphic processors), how problems are decomposed into parallel parts, and how programs can be optimized for different computer and accelerator architectures.

The following topics are covered:

- Introduction to homogeneous and heterogeneous parallel computers.
- Introduction to graphic processors and accelerators.
- How problems are decomposed to enable parallel execution.
- OpenMP.
- How to write programs for computer clusters using, e.g., MPI.
- How to write programs for graphic processors using, e.g. CUDA.
- Parallel patterns, such as prefix sum, map-reduce, matrix calculations, merge sort, and graph search.
- Examples of how parallel processing is used within different domains, such as machine learning, image processing, and image analysis.
- How to plan and deploy (virtual) clusters and parallel application in a cloud.
- Common benchmarks and how they are used to evaluate performance.
- Tools to test and debug parallel programs.

## Types of instruction

The instruction consists of lectures, seminars, and teacher-supervised laboratory sessions. The course also contains a series of guest lectures where representatives from industry and research discusses how and why they use parallel computers and accelerators in their work and how they use these to solve problems.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`TEN1`| Written exam   | A-F   | 1     |  
|`LAB1`| Programming assignments | A-F   | 4     |  

To pass the course, grade E or higher is required for all parts. The final grade is decided from: `TEN1`(30%) and `LAB1`(70%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

| Outcome |`TEN1` |`LAB1` |
| :--------- | :---: | :---: |
| 1.1        | **X** | **X** |
| 1.2        | **X** |       |
| 1.3        | **X** | **X** |
| 2.1        |       | **X** |
| 2.2        |       | **X** |
| 2.3        |       | **X** |
| 3.1        | **X** |       |

## Reading list

Required reading:

- Kirk, D. and Hwu, W-M., *Programming Massively Parallel Processors - A Hands-on Approach*, third edition, Morgan Kaufmann, 2016. Pages: 500 of 576
- Compendium of scientific articles.

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
