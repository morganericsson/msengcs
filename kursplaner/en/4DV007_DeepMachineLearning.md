## Learnings outcomes

After completing the course the student shall be able to:

*1. Knowledge and understanding*
	1. Describe the foundation and applications of deep learning,
	2. explain methods for reinforcement learning, planning, and control in sequential decision making processes, and
	3. explain the limitations of a model in a given context.
*2.	Skills and abilities*
	1. Implement deep learning models in a state of the art framework, such as tensorflow or keras, 
	2. apply concepts from deep learning to solve tasks such as image recognition, 
	3. represent data in ways to facilitate learning, and
	4. recognize the effects of bad initialization, parameters, and hyperparameters, and suggest ways to change these to improve the results.
*3.	Judgement and approach*
	1. Critically reflect on the value of a scientific result, as well as summarize, present, and discuss findings from scientific articles, as well as the effect these research results have on society.

## Course contents

The course covers concepts and methods from neural networks and deep learning.

The following topics are covered:

- Neural networks and convolutional neural networks
- Optimization in training deep learning models
- Regularization for deep learning
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Recurrent networks
- Long-short term memory
- Reinforcement learning

## Types of instruction

The instruction consists of lectures, teacher-supervised laboratory sessions, seminars, where pairs of students present a scientific article and acts as opponents on another student presentation.

## Examination

The examination of the course is divided into the following parts:

| Code | Name             | Grade | HEC | 
| :--- | :-------------------- | :---: | :---: |
|`TEN1`| Written exam                   | A-F   | 2     |
|`LAB1`| Programming assignments                | A-F   | 2     |
|`PRS1`| Presentation of a scientific article | G-U   | 1     |

To pass the course, grade G is required on `PRS1` and grade E or higher is required for all other parts. The final grade is decided from: `TEN1` (50%) and `LAB1` (50%).

## Methods of Evaluation

The learning outcomes are evaluated as follows:

| Outcome |`TEN1` |`LAB1` |`PRS1` |
| :--------- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.1        |       | **X** |       |
| 1.2        | **X** | **X** |       |
| 1.3        | **X** | **X** |       |
| 2.1        | **X** |       |       |
| 2.2        | **X** |       |       |
| 2.3        | **X** |       |       |
| 2.4        | **X** | **X** |       |
| 3.1        |       |       | **X** |

## Reading list

Required reading:

- Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., and Courville, A., *Deep learning*, MIT Press, 2016. Pages: 465 of 710.
- Compendium of scientific articles.

## Other information

The course is conducted in such a way that the course participants' experiences and knowledge are made visible and developed. This means, for example, that we have an inclusive approach and strive for no one to feel excluded. This can be expressed in different ways in a course, for example by using the gender neutral example.
